### What Exactly is the PM Surya Ghar Scheme?

Launched in February 2024, the PM Surya Ghar scheme is a massive initiative by the Indian government with a budget of over [₹75,000 crore](https://pmsuryagharyojana.in/). The main goal is simple: to help [1 crore households](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/pmsgmb) install their own rooftop solar power systems.

By generating your own electricity from the sun, you can drastically reduce or even eliminate your monthly bills. The "Muft Bijli" in the name literally means "Free Electricity," and that's what this scheme aims to deliver.

### The Amazing Benefits for You

So, what’s in it for you? A lot, actually!

* **Slash Your Electricity Bills:** This is the biggest perk. By generating your own power, you won't have to rely as much on the grid. Many families can save up to 300 units of electricity every month, which could mean savings of [₹15,000 to ₹18,000 per year](https://freyrenergy.com/how-to-benefit-from-pm-surya-ghar-muft-bijli-yojana/).
* **Earn Extra Income:** What if you produce more electricity than you use? With [net metering](https://blog.solarclue.com/blog/2025-solar-subsidies-by-state-complete-guide-to-government-schemes/), you can sell the surplus power back to your local electricity distribution company (DISCOM) and earn money.
* **Government Pays a Big Chunk:** The scheme provides a substantial subsidy to reduce the initial cost of installation. More on this below!
* **Easy, Low-Interest Loans:** Need help with the upfront cost? The government has made arrangements for [collateral-free loans](https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/specificdocs/documents/2024/aug/doc2024812373601.pdf) with interest rates as low as 7%.
