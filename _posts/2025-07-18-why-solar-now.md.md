# Why Solar Now?  
### An Analytical Look at India’s Rooftop Solar Opportunity in 2025–26

India is at a pivotal moment in its energy transition. With a national solar capacity of nearly [98 GW as of December 2024](https://mnre.gov.in/en/physical-progress/), and rooftop installations accelerating due to targeted incentives, 2025–26 marks a strategic window for solar adoption. This post outlines why the current period represents an optimal intersection of policy, economics, and technology for residential and commercial solar uptake.

## 1. National Context: High Absolute Growth, Low Per Capita Penetration

India ranks 3rd globally in total installed solar capacity. However, per capita solar adoption remains low:

| Country    | Installed Capacity (GW) | Per Capita Capacity (W) |
|------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Australia  | 35+                      | [1,437](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2025/04/11/india-installs-24-gw-of-solar-in-fiscal-2025/) |
| Germany    | ~100                     | [1,069](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2025/04/11/india-installs-24-gw-of-solar-in-fiscal-2025/) |
| USA        | ~248                     | [519](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2025/04/11/india-installs-24-gw-of-solar-in-fiscal-2025/) |
| Japan      | 91                       | [744](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2025/04/11/india-installs-24-gw-of-solar-in-fiscal-2025/) |
| **India**  | **97.86**                | [69](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2025/04/11/india-installs-24-gw-of-solar-in-fiscal-2025/)    |

This disparity indicates that despite national growth, a significant portion of the population and infrastructure remains untapped — especially in the residential sector.

## 2. Policy Incentives: PM Surya Ghar Scheme

The Government of India’s [PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana](https://www.india.gov.in/spotlight/pm-surya-ghar-muft-bijli-yojana), launched in 2024, is central to the current rooftop growth:

- **Subsidy Support**:
  - ₹30,000 for 1 kW
  - ₹60,000 for 2 kW
  - ₹78,000 for 3 kW (maximum)
- **Eligibility**: Residential rooftop systems up to 3 kW
- **Online portal**: [National Portal for Rooftop Solar](https://solarrooftop.gov.in) for application and vendor selection
- **Target**: [10 million homes by FY 2026–27](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2111106)

[Over 1 million homes](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2111106) installed rooftop systems under this scheme within the first year, contributing over 3 GW of capacity.

## 3. Financial Economics: Cost, Payback, and ROI

### 3.1 Cost Trends

- Module costs have [dropped 95%](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/renewable-energy/from-rs-200-to-rs-9-plummeting-solar-costs-could-spark-indias-clean-energy-revolution) from 2010 to 2024.
- Current benchmark installation cost: ₹45,000–₹60,000/kW (before subsidy)
- After subsidy, effective cost for 3 kW system: ~₹70,000

### 3.2 Payback Period

- Estimated: [**3–5 years**](https://freyrenergy.com/why-solar-rooftop-system-is-good-investment-in-2024/) depending on state tariff and system size

### 3.3 Return on Investment

- Annual ROI: Estimated [**20–30%**](https://www.sungarner.com/blogs/home/details/how-solar-power-can-cut-your-electricity-bill)

## 4. Grid Tariffs and Regulatory Environment

### 4.1 Time-of-Day (ToD) Tariffs

Implemented from [April 2025](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1934673) for all consumers with smart meters:

- **Solar Hours (e.g., 10am–4pm)**: 20% lower tariffs
- **Peak Hours (e.g., 6pm–10pm)**: 10–20% higher tariffs

If you have rooftop solar, you’ll naturally consume cheap daytime energy from your panels and avoid costly peak-hour charges. Add a battery later, and you’ll be nearly grid-independent.

### 4.2 Net Metering and Export Incentives

- Net metering allowed up to 500 kW nationally ([MNRE](https://mnre.gov.in/en/physical-progress/))
- Feed-in tariffs:
  - Gujarat: ₹2.25/kWh ([CAG Report](https://www.cag.org.in/blogs/overview-residential-rooftop-solar-installations-india-2025-part-2))
  - Uttarakhand: ₹5/kWh

## 5. Supply Chain: Domestic Manufacturing Growth

India has significantly increased its domestic solar manufacturing capacity:

| Component     | 2024 Capacity | 2025 Capacity |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Solar Cells   | 9 GW          | [25 GW](https://www.pv-tech.org/india-almost-trebles-cell-manufacturing-capacity-25gw-12-months-march-2025/) |
| Modules       | 38 GW         | [74 GW](https://www.pv-tech.org/india-almost-trebles-cell-manufacturing-capacity-25gw-12-months-march-2025/) |

- [First wafer/ingot facilities](https://www.pv-tech.org/india-almost-trebles-cell-manufacturing-capacity-25gw-12-months-march-2025/) commissioned in India
- [100% Made-in-India panels](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2111106) required for PM Surya Ghar subsidy
- Protected by [25–40% BCD](https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2025/01/18/residential-rooftop-solar-scheme-presents-over-inr-1-trillion-opportunity-for-component-manufacturers/)

## 6. Technological Infrastructure: Smart Meters and Integration

### 6.1 Smart Meter Rollout

- Over [23.9 million smart meters](https://powerline.net.in/2025/04/04/powering-ahead-smart-metering-progress-under-the-rdss/) deployed as of March 2025
- Enables automated ToD tariffs and net metering

### 6.2 System Efficiency

- Rooftop panels today: 18–21% efficiency with mono-PERC/TOPCon ([MNRE](https://mnre.gov.in/en/physical-progress/))
- Hybrid inverters and battery-ready systems becoming standard
- A 3 kW system yields ~300–360 kWh/month in most Indian states

## 7. Rooftop Solar Growth: Trajectory and Trends

- Total grid-connected rooftop solar as of mid-2025: [~18.8 GW](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2025/04/11/india-installs-24-gw-of-solar-in-fiscal-2025/)
- FY 2024–25 rooftop additions: [5.1 GW](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2025/04/11/india-installs-24-gw-of-solar-in-fiscal-2025/)

| Year        | Rooftop Additions (GW) | YoY Growth |
|-------------|-------------------------|------------|
| 2023–24     | 2.96                    | —          |
| 2024–25     | 5.1                     | +72%       |

## 8. Deployment Risks and Market Outlook

### 8.1 Risks

- Subsidy budgets may taper post-FY 2026–27
- Grid saturation risks in urban areas
- Possible policy shift from net metering to gross metering

### 8.2 Outlook

- Rooftop solar expected to contribute [~30 GW by 2030](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2111106)
- Supportive investment and policy climate expected through FY 2026
- Lower LCOE (₹2–4/unit) vs. grid tariffs (₹5–9/unit) ensures long-term viability

---

## Conclusion

The current policy and market landscape in India provides highly favorable conditions for rooftop solar deployment. With capital subsidies reducing upfront costs, rapidly improving economics, grid-friendly reforms such as ToD tariffs, and robust manufacturing supply chains, 2025–26 presents a strategically advantageous window for adoption.

Entities considering rooftop solar — whether residential, commercial, or institutional — have clear economic and operational incentives to act during this period. Delaying adoption may result in missed subsidy benefits, higher tariffs, and evolving regulatory constraints.
